<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at City University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~yugufang/" title="Supervisor">Yuguang "Michael" Fang</a>. I received my Ph.D. degree from Hunan University supervised by Prof. <a href="https://hongbojiang2004.github.io/en/" title="Supervisor">Hongbo Jiang</a>. From 2021 to 2022, I studied as a joint Ph.D. student at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. My research interests lie in the area of IoT system construction and security protection, mainly focusing on user identity authentication, privacy-preserving enabled wireless sensing, and multi-modal fusion-driven smart services. I have published papers in IEEE S&P, ACM Ubicomp/IMWUT, IEEE TMC, IEEE ICDCS, ACM ToSN, IEEE Communications Magazine, etc. I hope I can contribute my efforts to build an efficient and secure IoT framework, applying to our smart city system.
