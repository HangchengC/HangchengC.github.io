<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in City University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~yugufang/" title="Supervisor">Prof. Yuguang Fang</a>. I received my Ph.D. degree from the College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineer, Hunan University. From 2021 to 2022, I study as a joint Ph.D. student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I am also a technical leader of one industry-university-research cooperation project (2022-2023) supported by OPPO. My research interests lie in the area of IoT security, mainly focusing on user identity authentication, privacy-preserving driven wireless sensing, and multi-modal fusion energized event anomaly detection. I hope I can contribute my efforts to help build a secure IoT system. I have published papers in IEEE S\&P, ACM Ubicomp/IMWUT, IEEE TMC, IEEE ICDCS, ACM ToSN, IEEE IoT-J, IEEE Communications Magazine, etc.
