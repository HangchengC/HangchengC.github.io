<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in City University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~yugufang/" title="Supervisor">Prof. Yuguang Fang</a>. I received my Ph.D. degree (my advisors: <a href="https://hongbojiang2004.github.io/en/" title="Supervisor">Prof. Hongbo Jiang</a> and <a href="http://csee.hnu.edu.cn/people/xiekun" title="Supervisor">Prof. Kun Xie</a>) from the College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineer, Hunan University. From 2021 to 2022, I study as a joint Ph.D. student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I am also a technical leader of one industry-university-research cooperation project (2022-2023) supported by OPPO. My research interests lie in the area of IoT security, mainly focusing on user identity authentication, privacy-preserving enabled wireless sensing, and multi-modal fusion driven anomaly event detection. I have published papers in IEEE S&P, ACM Ubicomp/IMWUT, IEEE TMC, IEEE ICDCS, ACM ToSN, IEEE IoT-J, IEEE Communications Magazine, etc. I hope I can contribute my efforts to build a secure IoT framework, applying to our smart city system.
